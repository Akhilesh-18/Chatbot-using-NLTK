# Chatbot Using NLTK
Instead of offering direct contact with a real human agent, the chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation using text or text-to-speech.

The chatbot can be largely divided into two categories:

1. Text-based chatbots, such Customer Support Assistant

2. Chatbots that use voice or speech, such as Google Home, Alexa, Apple Siri, and Cortana

Text-based chatbots are further classified into two types-

1. Rule-Based Chatbots
2. AI (Artificial Intelligence) based Chatbots

Rule-based chatbots:
The bot answers the queries based on some pre-defined rules on which it is trained.

Advantages:

Rule-based chatbots are easy or faster to train
Accountable, Secure, and not restricted to the text interactions

Disadvantages:

It is not capable of handling complex queries
Interactions are not conversational
It requires a lot of manual work to generate or prepare rules for training the chatbot

Self-Learn or AI-Based Chatbots:
In a Self-learn or AI-based chatbot, the bots are machine learning-based programs that simulate human-like conversations using natural language processing (NLP).

Advantages:

Increase customer engagement by providing interactions conversational
Increase productivity by providing quick data collection and better lead generation


## Installation

Install the libraries by using the following commands

```bash
  pip install nltk  #for installing NLTK
  import nltk
  from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
  nltk.download('popular', quiet=True) # for downloading popular packages
  nltk.download('punkt')
  nltk.download('wordnet')
  import json
  import pickle
  import numpy
```
    
## Procedure

1. Importing necessary libraries

2. Data pre-processing

3. Creating training data

4. Creating a neural network model

5. Create functions to take user input, pre-process the input, predict the class, and get the response

6. Start the chatbot using the command line option

7. Build the GUI using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library

8. Start the chatbot using Tkinter GUI
